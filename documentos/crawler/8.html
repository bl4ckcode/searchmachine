Most schools offer free condoms. My school had a nurse there every day and you could go in and ask for condoms. We had a doctor come in once a month and do STI tests and give out BC prescription yet we still had pregnant teens. We get sex ed in grade 9 and that's it however recently they changed the curriculum so sex ed starts in grade 1 so hopefully this changes. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (3 replies) [–]TJGibson 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago* (0 children) HEY!!

The average debt in the UK is higher than both, over £32,000 (which is circa $43,000 USD), but I'd happily take £100,000 of debt under the UK system over a third of that in the US system (I should note Scotland offers free university so things are different there). The problem is the repayment expectation. With English student loans, you don't need to pay back anything if you earn under £21,000 per annum, and that's soon to rise to £25,000 (for comparison, the median UK income is around £27,000 per annum for full-time workers). Then the amount paid is 9% of what you earn above the threshold. So if you're earning £30,000 per year, you'll pay £450 per year towards your loan under the planned scheme. Then after 30 years the entire thing is written off irrespective of how much you've paid, so if you only earn £30,000 for life you only pay around £13,500 even if your original debt was (for example) £50,000. If you end up on minimum wage for your entire working life, you never pay back a penny. In the US (and Canada?), you're expected to pay your debt in full, no matter how much you earn, and at a much quicker rate. So if the bottom falls out of the graduate jobs market, or you're stuck in a town with no opportunities, or something, it's a case of tough shit, pay up anyway. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (1 reply) [–]steflund 9 points10 points11 points 3 hours ago (0 children) Nowhere near as bad as the states, and you’re much more protected here. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]Knuk 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children) Depends on the province, had college at around 150$ per semester and university around 1500$ per semester in Quebec.

Do people really still try to use that excuse these days? permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]iamsortoffakenews 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children) They do but iirc the daughter always skipped school to drink/smoke. Most schools offer free condoms. My school had a nurse there every day and you could go in and ask for condoms. We had a doctor come in once a month and do STI tests and give out BC prescription yet we still had pregnant teens. We get sex ed in grade 9 and that's it however recently they changed the curriculum so sex ed starts in grade 1 so hopefully this changes. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (3 replies) [–]TJGibson 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago* (0 children) HEY!!

The average debt in the UK is higher than both, over £32,000 (which is circa $43,000 USD), but I'd happily take £100,000 of debt under the UK system over a third of that in the US system (I should note Scotland offers free university so things are different there). The problem is the repayment expectation. With English student loans, you don't need to pay back anything if you earn under £21,000 per annum, and that's soon to rise to £25,000 (for comparison, the median UK income is around £27,000 per annum for full-time workers). Then the amount paid is 9% of what you earn above the threshold. So if you're earning £30,000 per year, you'll pay £450 per year towards your loan under the planned scheme. Then after 30 years the entire thing is written off irrespective of how much you've paid, so if you only earn £30,000 for life you only pay around £13,500 even if your original debt was (for example) £50,000. If you end up on minimum wage for your entire working life, you never pay back a penny. In the US (and Canada?), you're expected to pay your debt in full, no matter how much you earn, and at a much quicker rate. So if the bottom falls out of the graduate jobs market, or you're stuck in a town with no opportunities, or something, it's a case of tough shit, pay up anyway. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (1 reply) [–]steflund 9 points10 points11 points 3 hours ago (0 children) Nowhere near as bad as the states, and you’re much more protected here. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]Knuk 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children) Depends on the province, had college at around 150$ per semester and university around 1500$ per semester in Quebec.
