If this came from China, they have a habit of kicking poor people out of their homes in order to do construction in the area. I mean it has its own wiki and everything: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_evictions_in_China And the most famous example is when they evicted entire neighborhoods to build facilities for the 2008 Olympics. They also engage in a lot of strong-arm tactics to get residents to comply. Up to an including just flat out hiring people to beat the folks who refuse to move or who are protesting.

It’s obvious that the women was the instigator, but a full on ‘this is Sparta’ kick seems way too over the top.

Everyone's got a "justice" boner for this type of shit*. If she was lynched, Reddit would have loved it. No one gives a shit, they just want to see extreme retribution. Personally, I think the dudes a bitch for kicking a person like that. You can defuse the situation other ways. Edit: Spelling permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]MeadKingofRuddyHall1 36 points37 points38 points 1 hour ago (8 children) Yea man Reddit has a fucking boner for woman getting the crap beaten out of them if they instigated a fight or something. They'll always comment shit like, "shouldn't have hit a man 3x bigger than you if you didnt want to get wrecked." Its fucking disgusting. I don't care if this makes me a neckbeard, white knight, sexist, or whatever buzzword, I'm not going to hit a woman no matter what she did or instigated unless my life is in imminent danger. She fucking threw water and Reddit thinks this is some huge moral victory permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]OneBlueAstronaut 14 points15 points16 points 52 minutes ago (1 child) /r/pussypassdenied is basically just /r/violenceagainstwomen.

The problem with that logic is that in most civilized countries the guy who kicked would have been arrested for unnecessary use of force, so no she does not deserve to be attacked that way. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (35 replies) [–]Chrispy365 12 points13 points14 points 1 hour ago (1 child) Not to mention it's on concrete, if she had have hit her head falling backwards it could have easily killed her permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (1 reply) [–]TheBiolizard 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour ago (0 children) Retributive justice is well loved here. Whether she deserved it or not, the fact that she slightly instigated it first means she is the bad guy. Or at least that is how most of the Internet perceives it. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]HELP_ME_I_Need_Nudes 8 points9 points10 points 1 hour ago (0 children) In these situations I'd like to see a retaliation that is just a few ticks above what an instigator is doing. So if that was 60oz of water at 200 deg F, she gets 62oz of water at 202 deg F. That kick was straight fire. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]sayleanenlarge 18 points19 points20 points 1 hour ago (1 child) They love women getting "what they deserve" on reddit. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (1 reply) [–]apple_kicks 6 points7 points8 points 1 hour ago (0 children) Also we don’t know why she threw the water maybe they started it or did something.

If this came from China, they have a habit of kicking poor people out of their homes in order to do construction in the area. I mean it has its own wiki and everything: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_evictions_in_China And the most famous example is when they evicted entire neighborhoods to build facilities for the 2008 Olympics. They also engage in a lot of strong-arm tactics to get residents to comply. Up to an including just flat out hiring people to beat the folks who refuse to move or who are protesting. But this is reddit so as usual they see a no context gif of a woman getting kicked over for throwing water so pussypassdenied/justiceserved comes out in full force to masturbate all over the comment section. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (26 replies) [–]Blobbentein 7 points8 points9 points 2 hours ago (0 children) DAS BOOT permalink embed save report give gold reply [–]guy_fawkes9301 13 points14 points15 points 3 hours ago (4 children) r/gifsthatendtoosoon permalink embed save report give gold reply load more comments (4 replies) [–]nuggied_one 16 points17 points18 points 4 hours ago (0 children) I'm sure his sensei would be proud.

I've seen videos of police beating an old man down and stomping on his head with both feet. permalink embed save report give gold reply [–]AZWxMan 6 points7 points8 points 1 hour ago (0 children) I had to scroll way way down to find a post that suggests there may be a reason for the initial action of throwing the water on the workers.
