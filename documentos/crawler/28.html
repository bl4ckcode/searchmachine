"Showerthought" is a loose term that applies to the types of thoughts you might have while carrying out a routine task like showering, driving, or daydreaming. At their best, Showerthoughts are universally relatable and find the amusing/interesting within the mundane. Please be respectful of others' submissions. Rudeness is unacceptable. Rules All content must be original and unique. Submissions that match (or echo similar sentiments to) ideas offered by other people will be removed, regardless of whether or not those ideas have appeared on reddit. Blatant reposting and plagiarism may result in a ban.» Your entire thought must be in the title. Any further information needs to be posted in the "body" section of your post. No shower "observations." A description of something in a literal shower (or bathroom) is not a showerthought. » No jokes, puns, or wordplay. » No "life pro-tips" or advice. » No commentary on Reddit or its functions. Ideas for Reddit features should be posted in /r/IdeasForTheAdmins. » No thoughts about politics, social justice, or religion. » Don't be a jerk. » Please see the full rules page for a full explanation of each of the preceding rules. Exceedingly nonsensical or common thoughts will be removed at the discretion of the moderation team, as will thoughts that are poorly written, overly vulgar, or obscene. This subreddit is moderated for quality, which means we remove content that we deem to be low-quality, low-effort, nonsensical, or common/unoriginal. We do not "let the votes decide." We understand this type of policy is controversial and uncommon (especially for a default subreddit), but we believe it gives /r/Showerthoughts the best chance at maintaining quality.

I feel there's a fundamental weirdness with this owing to the definition of the word "lick". When it comes to a mirror its similar to saying the only part of a mirror that you can "touch" is the part that's touching it. The emphasis being on touching. Now we have a word for when the tongue touches anything called "lick" so obviously it could only lick itself. If I created a word to mean when my dick touched something to be "dickle" then of course the only part of the mirror I could dickle would be my cock. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (10 replies) [–]virtualmitch101 2321 points2322 points2323 points 6 hours ago (20 children) oh great guru...may I follow you and learn from your teachings?! permalink embed save report give gold reply [–]gnarfler 441 points442 points443 points 5 hours ago (13 children) To truly follow one must lead themselves permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]virtualmitch101 166 points167 points168 points 5 hours ago (9 children) <turns head...follows /u/gnarfler> permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]CardboardDreams[S] 124 points125 points126 points 5 hours ago (6 children) Splitter! permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]gisquestions 8 points9 points10 points 1 hour ago (5 children) *I sprint up to you* *you look at me puzzled* *I slap you across the face* "Oww, what the fuck?!" you exclaim *I latch onto your hips and begin furiously humping you* permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]HemaG33 15 points16 points17 points 1 hour ago (1 child) OwO what's this? permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]_Serene_ 6 points7 points8 points 1 hour ago (0 children) Rawr xD permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]jamescgames 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour ago (0 children) Huh? permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (2 replies) [–]Cakepufft 15 points16 points17 points 1 hour ago (1 child) Before I read your comment, I thought it was html.

There is a small separation between the outside of the glass and the reflective surface of the mirror. If "lick" means to make contact with the outside of the glass, and whatever is on the reflective surface is what you are licking, there is some vanishingly small amount of time between contact and reflection. You don't even have to move faster than light; your tongue is always making contact with the glass before the reflection occurs...

"Showerthought" is a loose term that applies to the types of thoughts you might have while carrying out a routine task like showering, driving, or daydreaming. At their best, Showerthoughts are universally relatable and find the amusing/interesting within the mundane. Please be respectful of others' submissions. Rudeness is unacceptable. Rules All content must be original and unique. Submissions that match (or echo similar sentiments to) ideas offered by other people will be removed, regardless of whether or not those ideas have appeared on reddit. Blatant reposting and plagiarism may result in a ban.» Your entire thought must be in the title. Any further information needs to be posted in the "body" section of your post. No shower "observations." A description of something in a literal shower (or bathroom) is not a showerthought. » No jokes, puns, or wordplay. » No "life pro-tips" or advice. » No commentary on Reddit or its functions. Ideas for Reddit features should be posted in /r/IdeasForTheAdmins. » No thoughts about politics, social justice, or religion. » Don't be a jerk. » Please see the full rules page for a full explanation of each of the preceding rules. Exceedingly nonsensical or common thoughts will be removed at the discretion of the moderation team, as will thoughts that are poorly written, overly vulgar, or obscene. This subreddit is moderated for quality, which means we remove content that we deem to be low-quality, low-effort, nonsensical, or common/unoriginal. We do not "let the votes decide." We understand this type of policy is controversial and uncommon (especially for a default subreddit), but we believe it gives /r/Showerthoughts the best chance at maintaining quality.

I feel there's a fundamental weirdness with this owing to the definition of the word "lick". When it comes to a mirror its similar to saying the only part of a mirror that you can "touch" is the part that's touching it. The emphasis being on touching. Now we have a word for when the tongue touches anything called "lick" so obviously it could only lick itself. If I created a word to mean when my dick touched something to be "dickle" then of course the only part of the mirror I could dickle would be my cock. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (10 replies) [–]virtualmitch101 2321 points2322 points2323 points 6 hours ago (20 children) oh great guru...may I follow you and learn from your teachings?! permalink embed save report give gold reply [–]gnarfler 441 points442 points443 points 5 hours ago (13 children) To truly follow one must lead themselves permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]virtualmitch101 166 points167 points168 points 5 hours ago (9 children) <turns head...follows /u/gnarfler> permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]CardboardDreams[S] 124 points125 points126 points 5 hours ago (6 children) Splitter! permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]gisquestions 8 points9 points10 points 1 hour ago (5 children) *I sprint up to you* *you look at me puzzled* *I slap you across the face* "Oww, what the fuck?!" you exclaim *I latch onto your hips and begin furiously humping you* permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]HemaG33 15 points16 points17 points 1 hour ago (1 child) OwO what's this? permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]_Serene_ 6 points7 points8 points 1 hour ago (0 children) Rawr xD permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]jamescgames 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour ago (0 children) Huh? permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (2 replies) [–]Cakepufft 15 points16 points17 points 1 hour ago (1 child) Before I read your comment, I thought it was html.

There is a small separation between the outside of the glass and the reflective surface of the mirror. If "lick" means to make contact with the outside of the glass, and whatever is on the reflective surface is what you are licking, there is some vanishingly small amount of time between contact and reflection. You don't even have to move faster than light; your tongue is always making contact with the glass before the reflection occurs...
