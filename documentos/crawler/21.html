I get it now. I'm a machinist and and do work with things with equal spacing. If I had 3 holes on a straight plane, labeled A B C. I would say "Make sure the space between A, B, and C, are equal." Or equidistant. I would not think to specify the 2 spaces like you did. Makes sense though.

Its easier to read if you capitalise the phrase you're describing or use commas: The gaps between ADAM and AND, and AND and EVE, should be equal. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (2 replies) [–]mordecai98 86 points87 points88 points 4 hours ago (9 children) Where is the Oxford comma, Dammit! permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]XenorVW 48 points49 points50 points 2 hours ago (4 children) There's only two items in the list, Adam and and, also there is and and Eve. No need for an Oxford comma with only two items. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]SYZekrom 23 points24 points25 points 2 hours ago (0 children) Fuck me and is a real word? He could have made it "Gaps between Adam, and, and Eve" though. Also, I'm pretty sure parallel structure is a thing, so it should be "Gaps between Adam and and and between and and Eve". permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (3 replies) load more comments (4 replies) [–]roman1231 12 points13 points14 points 2 hours ago (1 child) Martin Gardner once said "Wouldn't the sentence 'I want to put a hyphen between the words Fish and And and And and Chips in my Fish-And-Chips sign' have been clearer if quotation marks had been placed before Fish, and between Fish and and, and and and And, and And and and, and and and And, and And and and, and and and Chips, as well as after Chips?" This sentence is much easier to read because the writer placed commas between and and & and and and And, & and and and And & and And and and, & and And and and & and and and And, & and and and And & and And and and, & and And and and & and and and. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]superpaulyboy 3 points4 points5 points 2 hours ago (0 children) Beautiful permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]melbbear 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours ago (1 child) Adam and Eve is an adult sex toy/porn store where i’m from permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]maxwellsearcy 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (0 children) Yeah, it is an adult store everywhere.
