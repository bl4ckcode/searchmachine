Trespassing, disturbing the peace, protesting without a permit, blocking public right-of-way. Then it gets into resisting arrest, disobeying police orders, inciting unlawful conduct, etc. Several of those are misdemeanors, a few may be considered felonies these days. Protesting in America can be really dangerous, especially if you want to do it somewhere where you'll be seen. After the GWB-era, the only safe place you can protest is a fenced in "Free speech zone" under a bridge, several miles away from the actual thing your protesting against. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]fightingforair 848 points849 points850 points 3 hours ago (177 children) Oh don’t worry There are allowed protests areas Wayyyyyy over here Inside this fenced area 8x12 In rural Iowa.

I keep thinking about how we read about the falls of the Roman and Mongol and other Empires in terms of military strategy and geopolitical and economic conditions. We learn such and such set of facts led to such and such outcome. The weird part of seeing the decline of a civilization first hand is seeing the pivot toward stupid. It makes me think that that was probably the defining characteristic in all these declines. People in a civil society just eventually veer off into the path of greed, apathy, entitlement, and proud ignorance.

Look at Caesar and his conquests. Money bought power, conquest brought cash. Genocides were waged to fund Caesar's ambitions, and the people cheered for him. Meanwhile, a few perceptive senators railed against his illegal war and his dishonorable conduct in treating with foreigners. Then civil war as the people were caught between their favorite grass-roots politician and the lawful state. Eventually, the noble and the greedy united to stop Caesar; but his allies just swarmed the vacuum. Poor Cicero was later executed and displayed in pieces for criticizing the autocratic oligarchy that had come to replace the aristocratic republic. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]xXsnip_ur_ballsXx 37 points38 points39 points 2 hours ago (1 child) To be fair those aristocrats had also murdered the Gracchi a hundred years earlier for attempting some much-needed reforms. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply continue this thread [–]halfwaymysandwich 27 points28 points29 points 2 hours ago (2 children) so this is how democracy dies, with the quartering of men permalink embed save parent report give gold reply continue this thread load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (6 replies) [–]AyeGee 47 points48 points49 points 2 hours ago* (34 children) The US was labelled a Flawed Democracy the last time I saw a list of the most Democratic countries in the world.

There's little incentive for the government to be honest and say that it's really difficult to protect against these types of attacks. People turned to politicians to do something, stripping liberties was really their only play.

Consequences are for the people, not for corporations. If the corporations and the people leading them want to steal from people, poison the air and water causing death and illness, or simply refuse to contribute what they legally should, that's their freedom to do so.

Healthcare is inefficient in the US, because the GOP keeps obstructing Congress.

High distributive taxes are a basic and important aspect of a modern, free society. I think the West should just implement turn-over taxes and be done with it. Taxes on profits makes sense for start-ups where you don't want to punish small companies for making a loss. However, when dealing with large cap multinationals turnover taxes make more sense. Just take their turnover in the region and charge a flat rate on all money collected in the territory.

Trespassing, disturbing the peace, protesting without a permit, blocking public right-of-way. Then it gets into resisting arrest, disobeying police orders, inciting unlawful conduct, etc. Several of those are misdemeanors, a few may be considered felonies these days. Protesting in America can be really dangerous, especially if you want to do it somewhere where you'll be seen.

We learn such and such set of facts led to such and such outcome. The weird part of seeing the decline of a civilization first hand is seeing the pivot toward stupid. It makes me think that that was probably the defining characteristic in all these declines. People in a civil society just eventually veer off into the path of greed, apathy, entitlement, and proud ignorance.

Look at Caesar and his conquests. Money bought power, conquest brought cash. Genocides were waged to fund Caesar's ambitions, and the people cheered for him. Meanwhile, a few perceptive senators railed against his illegal war and his dishonorable conduct in treating with foreigners. Then civil war as the people were caught between their favorite grass-roots politician and the lawful state. Eventually, the noble and the greedy united to stop Caesar; but his allies just swarmed the vacuum.

I am moving back to NL in 2 weeks. I am okay with the 45% tax that I will be paying as they make my life so much better... affordable and good healthcare, education, public transport, roads etc. A lot less worries. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]general__nuisance 3 points4 points5 points 2 hours ago (9 children) Because taxes in the US are already to high and the tax code to complex. I'm self-employed, an independent contractor , adding every tax I have at least 22 separate tax filings in a year and on the low end my effective tax rate is over 45%. That's way to high. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]HelenEk7 6 points7 points8 points 1 hour ago (6 children) ..45%. That's way to high. I live in Norway, and know no one paying that much taxes.. Most pay 25% income tax. If you earn REALLY well you might pay 30%.. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]magnusbe 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (4 children) I think the average income tax is more like 36 % in Norway. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (4 replies) load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (2 replies) load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (23 replies) [–]prodmerc 17 points18 points19 points 2 hours ago (1 child) Wait what? In half of the EU, the citizens know that those taxes go towards helping them and society. It's not the US where the tax money goes towards war, propping up shit mega corps, and people are glad to pay $300/month for healthcare if it means no one else can use that money to save their lives. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (1 reply) [–]DavidlikesPeace 78 points79 points80 points 6 hours ago (23 children) The government is the people, and the people are the government. I am so glad that in parts of the world, people see the need for a well-funded government that isn't dominated by the elite and that works for the middle & lower classes. Blaming gov't is blaming yourself. You can't succeed in a modern society without government, so framing it as the villain is stupid. You can't even win a war without government, superhero movies excluded. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (23 replies) [–]ess_tee_you 4 points5 points6 points 3 hours ago (1 child) I think citizens are pissed off that they're paying taxes at the legal maximum for everything and corporations are paying the (loophole) legal minimum.

I hate Apple with a PASSION, but I am damn sure they have a mountain of lawyers figuring this out, and aren't illegally evading taxes.

High distributive taxes are a basic and important aspect of a modern, free society. I think the West should just implement turn-over taxes and be done with it. Taxes on profits makes sense for start-ups where you don't want to punish small companies for making a loss. However, when dealing with large cap multinationals turnover taxes make more sense. Just take their turnover in the region and charge a flat rate on all money collected in the territory. Stops all these crazy corporate structures to avoid taxes. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]whattalovelydaytoday 8 points9 points10 points 5 hours ago (0 children) Agree, but damn, I don't think it will happen in the life time of everyone reading this. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]grandoz039 7 points8 points9 points 3 hours ago (1 child) They make sense from perspective of preventing tax evasion.
