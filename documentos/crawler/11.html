We recommend watching these gifs at work or some other place where you can't laugh for the best experience. Rules: 1. Animated .gifs only Flash animations, videos or websites are not allowed. .gifv links are explictely allowed and even preferred if they are silent. 2. Imgur, gfycat or reddit All gifs must be hosted on imgur.com, gfycat.com or selfhosted on reddit, if you want to post a gif hosted on another site, reupload it. 3. Direct links please Any links that don't end in .gif or .gifv will be automatically removed. The exception here are gifs on gfycat, which should look like: https://gfycat.com/ThreeRandomWords.

At that point you're literally putting rubber bands on a corpse with the intention of crushing the skull and mutilating the corpse, which would make most people question your sanity. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]ProWaterboarder 28 points29 points30 points 6 hours ago (13 children) What if you only did it to the point of just killing them?

We recommend watching these gifs at work or some other place where you can't laugh for the best experience. Rules: 1. Animated .gifs only Flash animations, videos or websites are not allowed. .gifv links are explictely allowed and even preferred if they are silent. 2. Imgur, gfycat or reddit All gifs must be hosted on imgur.com, gfycat.com or selfhosted on reddit, if you want to post a gif hosted on another site, reupload it. 3. Direct links please Any links that don't end in .gif or .gifv will be automatically removed. The exception here are gifs on gfycat, which should look like: https://gfycat.com/ThreeRandomWords. Don't worry though, a bot will help you out with getting direct link to your .gif in case you make a little mistake. If you can't get it to work, you can contact the Moderators. 4. Self posts are meta posts Self posts are for meta discussions only and must have [META] in their title. All other self posts will be deleted without warning. 5. Don't Repost Use Karma Decay to check if you are reposting. Also, search the subreddit for the title of your submission. If your gif (or a near exact duplicate) has been posted within the past 6 months or is in top posts of the year or all time , don't post it again; there's no need for reposts within the same subreddit. If you see a repost, don't hesitate to report it. Don't get mad at reposter though (unless they're repeat offenders), there's no shame in accidentally reposting something, it happens to the best of us. 6. No joke titles It's okay to make your title funny, but this sub is about gifs, not texts. This also means no resubmitting the same gif with a different/better title. 7.
