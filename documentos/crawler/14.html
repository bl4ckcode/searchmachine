Stores in France on Saturday in a move aimed at pressuring the company to pay up on a €13 billion ($15.5 billion) tax bill to the European Union. In a press release, the France unit of the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions and Citizen's Action organization (Attac), said 100 of its members occupied the Opera Apple Store in Paris, demanding the company pay its taxes. Attac bills itself as an international movement that fights for financial market regulation and the closing of tax havens, among other goals. Attac said dozens of protests were organized at other Apple AAPL, -0.47%  store locations throughout France on Saturday. In the Paris store, where activists were seen via videos circulating on Twitter, pushing past security and hanging a banner that said “We will stop when Apple pays.” #RuptlyLive: 'We will stop when Apple pays' - ATTAC occupy the Paris Apple Store https://t.co/Ee1a9bAYg0 pic.twitter.com/DpLzmRZjun— Ruptly (@Ruptly) December 2, 2017 PARIS - ATTAC entre de force pour occuper de force un Apple Store. pic.twitter.com/7qRBWFFpAO— Clément Lanot (@ClementLanot) December 2, 2017 Security in Paris reportedly evacuated Apple workers from the building as those protests began: Situation en cours.

Opinion: How does Apple’s money get from California to Bermuda anyway? “Apple must stop denying the tax practices highlighted by the European Commission’s investigation, withdraw its appeal to the European Court of Justice and pay its fine of 13 billion euros as quickly as possible,” said Aurélie Trouvé, spokesman for Attac, according to the release. Trouvé added that to verify that Apple is paying correct taxes, the company must “publish its country-by-country reporting now and retroactively over the past few years. “ The European Commission has been in the process of investigating tax arrangements with multinationals across the region. It has referred Ireland to the European Court of Justice for failing to collect around €13 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple, citing illegal tax benefits. Both Apple and Ireland are appealing that decision.

Attac said the action was part of the #PhoneRevolt movement aimed at highlighting unfair practices by Apple, that are not just about taxes, but also pollution via extraction of metals for its phones, worker exploitation and driving a global consumption binge.
