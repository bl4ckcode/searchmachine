Holy shit... gDisasters â€¢ 16 points â€¢ submitted 1 day ago First, wood is so much less conductive than people that it literally explodes because of resistive heating... people on the other hand are mostly made of water. Then there's a problem of actually defining getting "stuck by lightning". Nearly all cases of people surviving after being struck by lightning involve them being hit indirectly. This is when they are hit by lightning's secondary effects (e.g. nearby side flash from a tree, contact with a metallic conductor, water, or simply being on ground). In the case of standing on ground, the current generated by lightning will enter the earth. Based on the distribution of varying resistivity in the soil, a corresponding voltage distribution will occur. Person standing in the direction of the voltage gradient could be subjected to hazardous voltages, which is called "stepping voltage". If he's standing on both feet (why not?), then current will not cross his heart and brain and will not cause fatal damage. view more:next â€º gDisasters u/gDisasters 1,311,494 Karma 1,228,941 Post Karma 82,553 Comment Karma Gallowboob's apprentice Follow Send a Private Message Following this user will show all the posts they make to their profile on your front page.
