Black culture has a unique way of examining the everyday and we are here to showcase that. RULES 1.) Do not post content just because a black person posted it. This sub is intended for exceptionally hilarious and insightful social media posts made by black people, not just any social media post made by black people. 1. No original content. We encourage users to go on twitter to find tweets as opposed to making tweets just for this subreddit. 2.) No bad faith participation. 3.) No bullying or witch-hunting. This includes comments disparaging people whose tweets and posts are featured here. Doxxing or sharing personal information will result in a permanent ban. 4.) No racism. No hate speech. No black fathers posts and similar mean-spirited things. 5.) Posts must be showcasing somebody being hilarious or insightful on social media. No image macros, text conversations, or YouTube links. Just because somebody posted one of these on social media does not exempt it from this rule. Vines and such belong here and gifs belong here. 6.) Typical reddit cliches such as lyric chains, pun chains, white-knighting, and low-effort joke comments will be removed. Same for annoying redditisms. 7.) Reposts are highly discouraged, and if discovered will be removed. Please search or look through BPT's older posts to see if your content has already been posted. KarmaDecay is not a reliable tool to check for reposts. 8.) No posts with terrible titles, they will be removed. You are free to re-submit once you think of something acceptable/reasonable. Don't put the punchline in the title of the post. Do not add "bruh" or "fam" or similar vernacular to your post or comment just to sound black. 9.) Don't complain about slang or ask for the definition of a term you don't understand if it can readily be found on urban dictionary. 10.) Don't call out people as white. People of all colors do post and comment here. It contributes nothing to the conversation and is punishable by ban. 11.) Don't post things from meme/corporate accounts. Posts must come from regular social media accounts. 12.) The moderators of this subreddit will take any action (which includes banning and removing comments) that they feel improves the quality of the subreddit.
