Tom Cruise sued over being called gay for example. The thing is tabloid companies actually factor lawsuits into their budgets, so they expect to be sued.

The plantiff is on the denfensive side ,if Hanks sues , he needs to provide evidence that he didn't do such thing ..

Hogan is already not a particularly poor man, and he had the backing of a billionaire to take down Gawker. What this shows is that those who can defend themselves are those at the top. How many were just as harshly (or way worse in many cases) slandered or ridculed by Gawker and its subsidiaries, and couldn't do shit about it? That's pretty fucked up. Basically: yay for the results, nay for the means. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]cbbuntz 19 points20 points21 points 3 hours ago (3 children) My cursory google search on the topic makes me think this would be classified as false light since it is misleading. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]WikiTextBot 14 points15 points16 points 3 hours ago (1 child) False light False light is a legal term that refers to a tort concerning privacy that is similar to the tort of defamation. The privacy laws in the United States include a non-public person's right to protection from publicity which puts the person in a false light to the public. That right is balanced against the First Amendment right of free speech. False light differs from defamation primarily in being intended "to protect the plaintiff's mental or emotional well-being", rather than to protect a plaintiff's reputation as is the case with the tort of defamation and in being about the impression created rather than being about veracity.

Downvote if you want, the laws the law. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]NotMyTypesType 1 point2 points3 points 16 minutes ago* (2 children) Satire and parody have specific definitions. Even the article says "[L]iability for satire and parody hinges on a reasonable person’s belief about the truthfulness of the commentary" In order for satire to be a defense, a reasonable individual has to believe the news is false. TOM HANKS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT could be very reasonable. Edit: And let's look at their guidelines for satire and parody Use an unorthodox headline to alert readers from the beginning that the story is not straight news and use an irreverent tone throughout the piece; Nope Consider your web site’s history, or lack thereof, of publishing satire or parody. If you generally publish only financial reports, for example, you should be more careful than a blogger or other online content provider who regularly publishes stories like those in the Onion; Nope Choose carefully the parody’s location on the site, making sure to avoid posting it among several straight news stories; Ooh front page of the website and top of their social media, below a bunch of real stories. That's a big NOPE. Include in the story unbelievable or outrageous items, experts or groups with ridiculous names or silly acronyms and quotes that are incredible, illogical or over-the-top; Nope Substitute fictitious names that are close to or suggest real people for the names of actual people; Nope Publish the parody soon after the actual incident while it is still in the public’s mind and, if possible, explicitly refer to that event in your commentary on it; Not relevant, since there was no real event Post a disclaimer but keep in mind that it will not necessarily avoid liability, especially if it is written in small print at the end of an otherwise believable story. Nope permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]TheGreatTempenstein -2 points-1 points0 points 15 minutes ago (1 child) If you only read the title and absolutely ignore the video.

The Onion is clear about their existence as satire. SNL's entire format is parody. A radio show that reports Tom Hanks accused of sexual harassment below articles about pet health, technology, and real celeb news is not being clear. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]TheGreatTempenstein 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes ago (1 child) Again, it's a video of a talking volleyball accusing a man of sexual harassment. It would be laughed out of any court room. This is literally what my degree is in. There is no legal leg to stand on, he's a public figure and anyone actually consuming the media would never believe it was true. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]NotMyTypesType 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute ago (0 children) The video is not the problem. The video sets up a joke and then answers it. The problem is all the written material on Facebook and their website outside of the video, that don't indicate it's a joke. A reasonable person reading the material without watching the video will get the impression Tom Hanks sexually harassed someone, and it's already happening on their social media anyone actually consuming the media would never believe Anyone watching the video. Not anyone clicking onto the website, reading the headline and opening the article. There's no expectation that people will watch a video accompanying a libelous article. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]tusig1243 111 points112 points113 points 5 hours ago (5 children) I hate the internet permalink embed save report give gold reply [–]jackster_ 74 points75 points76 points 3 hours ago (2 children) That's okay, it's about to change a whole lot! permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]MilesSand 9 points10 points11 points 2 hours ago (0 children) Yeah but let's face it sites like this will happily pay the fees to get on the cheap list or fast list (depending on which business model the ISP's go with in the US) We'll only see more of this trash and less small busines / community / unpaid stuff permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]mainfingertopwise -2 points-1 points0 points 1 hour ago (0 children) The amount of fantic panicking makes me want to bet money that nothing even happens. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]Ap100011 6 points7 points8 points 1 hour ago (1 child) Don't hate the internet, hate the people who ruin the internet. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]anoleiam 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children) I read it as "people who run the internet", but it kinda works both ways permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]nickbitty72 35 points36 points37 points 5 hours ago (0 children) Damn, I almost had a heart attack.

It says there's a video but it won't load for me. permalink embed save report give gold reply [–]Imalwaysneverthere 7 points8 points9 points 2 hours ago (1 child) It's because the website is archived.

I feel like it's a joke that's already been made on reddit, and nobody particularly cared. Ironically, stripped of context, it actually seems more outrageous than it is. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]NotMyTypesType 0 points1 point2 points 23 minutes ago (0 children) joke that's already been made on reddit, and nobody particularly cared It's different when it's clearly a joke. Right now on the front page of their website and the top of their social media is TOM HANKS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, there's nothing to indicate that it's a joke. You have to go out of your way to find the video. A fair number of comments on the Facebook page didn't even find the video, they just commented as if it were true because the website is presenting it as news. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]bucko_fazoo 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (1 child) dude, it's clickbait. the sub you're in is about subverting it, not buying into it. try caring less! permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]el_capistan 2 points3 points4 points 5 hours ago (0 children) Yeah I mean I don't really care that much since it isn't true.

Tom Cruise sued over being called gay for example. The thing is tabloid companies actually factor lawsuits into their budgets, so they expect to be sued.

The plantiff is on the denfensive side ,if Hanks sues , he needs to provide evidence that he didn't do such thing ..

Hogan is already not a particularly poor man, and he had the backing of a billionaire to take down Gawker. What this shows is that those who can defend themselves are those at the top. How many were just as harshly (or way worse in many cases) slandered or ridculed by Gawker and its subsidiaries, and couldn't do shit about it? That's pretty fucked up. Basically: yay for the results, nay for the means. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]cbbuntz 19 points20 points21 points 3 hours ago (3 children) My cursory google search on the topic makes me think this would be classified as false light since it is misleading. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]WikiTextBot 14 points15 points16 points 3 hours ago (1 child) False light False light is a legal term that refers to a tort concerning privacy that is similar to the tort of defamation. The privacy laws in the United States include a non-public person's right to protection from publicity which puts the person in a false light to the public. That right is balanced against the First Amendment right of free speech. False light differs from defamation primarily in being intended "to protect the plaintiff's mental or emotional well-being", rather than to protect a plaintiff's reputation as is the case with the tort of defamation and in being about the impression created rather than being about veracity.

Downvote if you want, the laws the law. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]NotMyTypesType 1 point2 points3 points 16 minutes ago* (2 children) Satire and parody have specific definitions. Even the article says "[L]iability for satire and parody hinges on a reasonable person’s belief about the truthfulness of the commentary" In order for satire to be a defense, a reasonable individual has to believe the news is false. TOM HANKS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT could be very reasonable. Edit: And let's look at their guidelines for satire and parody Use an unorthodox headline to alert readers from the beginning that the story is not straight news and use an irreverent tone throughout the piece; Nope Consider your web site’s history, or lack thereof, of publishing satire or parody. If you generally publish only financial reports, for example, you should be more careful than a blogger or other online content provider who regularly publishes stories like those in the Onion; Nope Choose carefully the parody’s location on the site, making sure to avoid posting it among several straight news stories; Ooh front page of the website and top of their social media, below a bunch of real stories. That's a big NOPE. Include in the story unbelievable or outrageous items, experts or groups with ridiculous names or silly acronyms and quotes that are incredible, illogical or over-the-top; Nope Substitute fictitious names that are close to or suggest real people for the names of actual people; Nope Publish the parody soon after the actual incident while it is still in the public’s mind and, if possible, explicitly refer to that event in your commentary on it; Not relevant, since there was no real event Post a disclaimer but keep in mind that it will not necessarily avoid liability, especially if it is written in small print at the end of an otherwise believable story. Nope permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]TheGreatTempenstein -2 points-1 points0 points 15 minutes ago (1 child) If you only read the title and absolutely ignore the video.

They include written content that contains no indicates it's a joke or that a joke is coming in the video. A reasonable reader could be misled to believe he has done this. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]NotMyTypesType 0 points1 point2 points 9 minutes ago (2 children) the onion and saturday night live exist. The Onion is clear about their existence as satire. SNL's entire format is parody. A radio show that reports Tom Hanks accused of sexual harassment below articles about pet health, technology, and real celeb news is not being clear. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]TheGreatTempenstein 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes ago (1 child) Again, it's a video of a talking volleyball accusing a man of sexual harassment. It would be laughed out of any court room. This is literally what my degree is in. There is no legal leg to stand on, he's a public figure and anyone actually consuming the media would never believe it was true. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]NotMyTypesType 0 points1 point2 points 1 minute ago (0 children) The video is not the problem. The video sets up a joke and then answers it. The problem is all the written material on Facebook and their website outside of the video, that don't indicate it's a joke. A reasonable person reading the material without watching the video will get the impression Tom Hanks sexually harassed someone, and it's already happening on their social media anyone actually consuming the media would never believe Anyone watching the video. Not anyone clicking onto the website, reading the headline and opening the article. There's no expectation that people will watch a video accompanying a libelous article. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]tusig1243 111 points112 points113 points 5 hours ago (5 children) I hate the internet permalink embed save report give gold reply [–]jackster_ 74 points75 points76 points 3 hours ago (2 children) That's okay, it's about to change a whole lot! permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]MilesSand 9 points10 points11 points 2 hours ago (0 children) Yeah but let's face it sites like this will happily pay the fees to get on the cheap list or fast list (depending on which business model the ISP's go with in the US) We'll only see more of this trash and less small busines / community / unpaid stuff permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]mainfingertopwise -2 points-1 points0 points 1 hour ago (0 children) The amount of fantic panicking makes me want to bet money that nothing even happens. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]Ap100011 6 points7 points8 points 1 hour ago (1 child) Don't hate the internet, hate the people who ruin the internet. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]anoleiam 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children) I read it as "people who run the internet", but it kinda works both ways permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]nickbitty72 35 points36 points37 points 5 hours ago (0 children) Damn, I almost had a heart attack.
