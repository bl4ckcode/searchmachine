Basically Some of it wicks into the wood most of it evaporates leaving behind some resins etc that harden. This won't be enough to make it slippery but many layers and huffing could. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]hummusFan420 [score hidden] 1 hour ago (0 children) As someone who has spent dozens of hours pulling staples out of maple this last week, I am so very excited to do this myself next week.
