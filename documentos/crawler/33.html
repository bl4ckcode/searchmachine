It’s there to keep the placenta out once they grow lungs. So newborns CAN be underwater without holding their breath. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]honeypinn 160 points161 points162 points 5 hours ago (26 children) While that is interesting, she was convinced that newborns have gills on their neck and would dissolve or some shit after a few minutes. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]song_pond 366 points367 points368 points 5 hours ago (15 children) No, they're sewn shut at the hospital. They have to do this because there were too many new moms who were taking their babies swimming in dirty lake water and the babies would get sick. So they do this to prevent illness. Very rarely, someone has a secretive home birth so the doctors at the hospital don't have a chance to do it. It's risky, but that's how we get mermaids. Their lives are shrouded in secrecy because the medical community would get really mad about it if they found out. That's also why some people don't believe in mermaids. Your girlfriend wasn't dumb.

It's not actually gills though, it's the thing that would develop into gills in fish. In humans it develops into the ear canal or something like that.

She would have been 30 something and I was 7 or 8 and I just knew this was bullshit. That was the beginning of my long discovery of "You know how stupid the average person is?

In some cases they are close enough to be the same.) permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]punlordjesus 8 points9 points10 points 4 hours ago (6 children) Average and mean ARE the same- I think you’re thinking of median, not mean.

You said "Jaguars are known to be cheetahs" Are they in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a netizen who just googled "Jaguar Cheetah Difference", I am telling you, specifically, on wikipedia, no one calls jaguars cheetahs. If you want to be "careful" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "Cheetah family" you're referring to the taxonomic family of Felidae, which includes things from ocelots to lions to Top Cat. So your reasoning for calling a jaguar a cheetah is because random people "call the black ones panthers?" Let's get tigers and Huey Newton in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jaguar is a jaguar and a member of the same family as cheetahs. But that's not what you said. You said a jaguar is a cheetah, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the Felidae family cheetahs, which means you'd call lynxes, smilodons, and Thomas O'Malley cheetahs, too. Which you know you wouldn't.

Don't get me wrong it's nice to breathe while you eat, between swallowing and such. When the food hole opens the air hole should shut. If your not gasping or dying for air and van control your throat hole no issues. I'm also not sure it's swallowing while underwater, it could be but chewing or biting underwater isn't overly hard at all. Especially not for those monsters of life. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (2 replies) [–]splergel 4 points5 points6 points 2 hours ago (0 children) As long as it's not saltwater, you'll be fine.

People who do free diving regularly can hold their breath for a very long time. Apparently the longest recorded time is 22 minutes, but that's without actually moving and cheating a little.

They have to do this because there were too many new moms who were taking their babies swimming in dirty lake water and the babies would get sick. So they do this to prevent illness. Very rarely, someone has a secretive home birth so the doctors at the hospital don't have a chance to do it. It's risky, but that's how we get mermaids. Their lives are shrouded in secrecy because the medical community would get really mad about it if they found out. That's also why some people don't believe in mermaids. Your girlfriend wasn't dumb.

You said "Jaguars are known to be cheetahs" Are they in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a netizen who just googled "Jaguar Cheetah Difference", I am telling you, specifically, on wikipedia, no one calls jaguars cheetahs. If you want to be "careful" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "Cheetah family" you're referring to the taxonomic family of Felidae, which includes things from ocelots to lions to Top Cat. So your reasoning for calling a jaguar a cheetah is because random people "call the black ones panthers?" Let's get tigers and Huey Newton in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jaguar is a jaguar and a member of the same family as cheetahs. But that's not what you said. You said a jaguar is a cheetah, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the Felidae family cheetahs, which means you'd call lynxes, smilodons, and Thomas O'Malley cheetahs, too. Which you know you wouldn't.
