She is there for fun, like Johnny or Timmy, but it's not about big effects or cool combos or deckbuilding. Instead, it's about craziness. She wants all the randomness possible just to make the games wacky and different. It may not be viable, it may not unique, it may not be big, but it's the unexpected that's fun. MtG can't really make too many cards like this because of the physical format, but Hearthstone can have cards like evolve and Yogg and Thoughtsteal and discover effects, etc. I have a friend who will play Yogg I'm whatever she can because it's her favorite card, and she wants more like that because it's just a casual silly game to play on her phone. Even nerfed she's going to play because it's about "what crazy thing could happen" and not enough effectiveness.
