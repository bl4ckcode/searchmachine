Why would you get a bag if you could make a shitty one out of wrapping paper? permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]TheTurnipKnight 30 points31 points32 points 6 hours ago (27 children) I don't really agree. You can get a bag, but all bag are the same and ugly. Everyone gives crappy gifts in these crappy fucking bags. Or you can be unique, put a little more work and heart into it, and make your own bag and it will mean more to the person who is receiving the gift. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]anim8rjb 134 points135 points136 points 6 hours ago (9 children) then after they tear it open in three seconds... ‘honey, did you like how I wrapped your bowling ball?’ ‘Oh...yeah, it was cool.’ permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]daybreakx 6 points7 points8 points 3 hours ago (1 child) 'Why the fuck did you get me a basketball?' permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]rfkz 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours ago* (0 children) Probably because he doesn't like the kid's parents and getting a drum kit would be too obvious.

Everyone gives crappy gifts in these crappy fucking bags. What? Every store I've ever been in that sells wrapping and bags has a huge wall with a huge selection of bag styles. This is no more unique or meaningful than just buying a bag. It's shit that goes in the trash. If you want to do something meaningful, make the damn gift. If anyone gives a shit about the type of wrapping they've got some fucked priorities. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]PM-YOUR-PMS 30 points31 points32 points 5 hours ago (0 children) "Thanks for the Rolex.

The only way they would know is if you told them, in which case they now have some garbage that they may feel socially inclined to keep because you "made" it. If you really want to put effort into packaging, then spend that effort sprucing up the bag. Add something to it, draw patterns or pictures, hell get some $2.00 stickers of something they like and slap them on there. I'd bet they'd notice and value a silly sketch on a cheap bag over a bag made of wrapping paper that just appears to be a bag. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]gn0xious 4 points5 points6 points 2 hours ago (0 children) Oh don’t worry, they’ll tell you if they made it. “Here you go, Merry Christmas! Do you like the bag? It’s cute right? I made it! I totally made it myself! I wanted it to be special for you, wasn’t that thoughtful?! Here I have a video on how I made it, be sure to like and subscribe, and share on Facebook!

And I'll probably buy more after Christmas. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]Fabreeze63 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (1 child) I have somewhat of an addiction to christmas wrapping paper.

Or maybe you're bedridden like Grampa Joe and don't have a Golden Ticket to motivate you to get out of bed? Or maybe your family is snowed in, and can't leave the house until after Christmas. Maybe the zombies have taken over the only store in town that sells bags?

Last year I bought all my gifts last minute , then ended up not having any wrapping paper or boxes. I had one gift bag so I kept giving people the gift, they would remove their gift and I'd take the bag back and put another gift in it lol permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (1 reply) [–]huevos_and_whiskey 79 points80 points81 points 6 hours ago (9 children) I was really hoping this would show how to wrap a basketball and end up with the paper neatly wrapped around it, so it would still be basketball shaped.

A ball has positive Gaussian curvature whereas the wrapping paper is flat and has zero Gaussian curvature. So it's impossible to wrap the paper neatly onto the ball because they have different curvatures. On the other hand, while a cylinder is curved along one axis, it nevertheless has zero Gaussian curvature and can be neatly wrapped using flat paper. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (2 replies) [–]chainmailtank 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children) I was hoping this was one of those "how to" videos with humorous rage and ineptitude. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]NeverRainingRoses 2 points3 points4 points 5 hours ago (0 children) That would totally have worked too, which is why this is extra strange?

Now for my rant: If someone is worth the time and expense of buying a gift for, they are also worth the trouble of wrapping their gift nicely! Cheap paper only works well if you wrap the item in tissue paper first. Tissue paper is VERY inexpensive! Every Dollar Tree, 99cent store, etc. has it available year round. But also be sure to get some good heavy wrapping paper, certain things require that.

The only way they would know is if you told them, in which case they now have some garbage that they may feel socially inclined to keep because you "made" it. If you really want to put effort into packaging, then spend that effort sprucing up the bag. Add something to it, draw patterns or pictures, hell get some $2.00 stickers of something they like and slap them on there. I'd bet they'd notice and value a silly sketch on a cheap bag over a bag made of wrapping paper that just appears to be a bag. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]gn0xious 4 points5 points6 points 2 hours ago (0 children) Oh don’t worry, they’ll tell you if they made it. “Here you go, Merry Christmas!

A ball has positive Gaussian curvature whereas the wrapping paper is flat and has zero Gaussian curvature. So it's impossible to wrap the paper neatly onto the ball because they have different curvatures. On the other hand, while a cylinder is curved along one axis, it nevertheless has zero Gaussian curvature and can be neatly wrapped using flat paper. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (2 replies) [–]chainmailtank 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children) I was hoping this was one of those "how to" videos with humorous rage and ineptitude. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]NeverRainingRoses 2 points3 points4 points 5 hours ago (0 children) That would totally have worked too, which is why this is extra strange?

Now for my rant: If someone is worth the time and expense of buying a gift for, they are also worth the trouble of wrapping their gift nicely! Cheap paper only works well if you wrap the item in tissue paper first. Tissue paper is VERY inexpensive! Every Dollar Tree, 99cent store, etc. has it available year round.
