Once it's reviewed and fixed, @OP should get his guaranteed collectible. If he doesn't, pull out the pitchforks. I completely agree with you on how they handled the call. If it was me handling this, I probably would've said, "I've checked with the specialist team and there's a discrepancy in what is being advertised, and what they understand is included. I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience and that you receive what was promised. We're requesting that you report this to our development team as a bug, using this form here. Once it the issue has been resolved, we can proceed on making sure that you've received all items as advertised." THAT is customer care. Not "Oh, yeah, specialist team says that's not what it says." That comes across as "You're lying to get free stuff." Ugh! permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]RazorRamonReigns 24 points25 points26 points 3 hours ago (1 child) At the very least refund the money and let the customer keep the pack. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]jabba-du-hutt 14 points15 points16 points 3 hours ago (0 children) Exactly! ANYTHING to at least let them know that, "We heard you. We understand that you're unhappy. While we fix this, here's your money back. Sorry for the misprint, or the bug." permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]dewdnoc 15 points16 points17 points 2 hours ago (2 children) Guy with over 15 years of customer service here. You were much better than the original rep for sure! However a big complaint I see often escalated is when the CSR suggests to the customer to do something else, like fill out a form to report the bug, or wait to get their problem resolved. In this case, the comer did their part in a.) Paying for the product (This generates revenue for the business & pays ever ones salaries. Great!) b.) Reporting the problem to customer service. The CSR should own the issue and submit the bug report on the players behalf. Additionally if the issue is minor and its clear that the company is at fault, just credit the guy back his purchase so he can make another. The bug probably only surfaces < .01% of the time, so he could most likely just purchase the same pack again and get his item. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]smrto0 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children) Yah, there is some great customer service advice in this thread... But... Then they outsource the CSR work to a company where that CSR can support up to 15 different products/companies and is limited to do exactly what is written in a Knowledge Document. They can’t go off script and even if they did they have zero connection to the actual company you are calling/emailing/messaging about. So, beside them emailing the company on your behalf there isn’t much they can do. Ps. They won’t email because it’s off script and it hurts their metrics to take the time to do so... Sigh, I’m just waiting for them to take customer service to the next level through crowdsourcing. You will literally just talk to another human who is having a similar issue to you and you can console each other. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]Rociel 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children) 6 years of customer service.

It's literally a for profit company that goes around selling accreditation. What you do is go to your credit card company. Your credit card company has far more weight in handling this situation as the item you purchased is not as advertised, however be warned that this could potentially cause a developer to ban your account [but dealing with the BBB wont do shit in most cases anyway]. The other way to do it is call them out on Twitter. I've found really great luck with solving an "unsolvable customer service problem" by just saying what happened on twitter with them tagged and some key hashtags. Problems that had no fix suddenly get fixed within an hour and them calling you. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]streetpack1 3 points4 points5 points 5 hours ago (3 children) Hey thanks for the feedback! Overall I agree with you but Ill elaborate a bit since this got bigger than our sub is used to. It was suggested because others have reported having success reporting them there in the past and to spread the word, not necessarily expecting the BBB to actually do something. The thing is not everybody buys these packs with money either because you can use in game coin. So you make the choice to gamble vs buying a player that you want on the auction house. Going to the credit card company like you mentioned is not the best solution because he risks a ban and further it would be Sony receiving the chargeback or Microsoft. The way they have it structured is fucked too because you need to buy points in order to buy packs. MasterCard/ Visa position would basically be that the service being provided are those points afterwards what you do with them is between you and the company. I think it's at least part of the reason you have to buy points in order to buy packs. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]egnards 2 points3 points4 points 5 hours ago (0 children) At that point you take it to Sony or Microsoft both via their CSR (which may not do much) or via social media. You let it be known that you bought points from them as the provider and their vendor (the studio) screwed you over - Microsoft and Sony both want you to be happy and keep buying stuff. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]ASPD_Account 1 point2 points3 points 5 hours ago (1 child) Charge back your CC for the pack and the game then dummy.

No Lawyer and I doubt EA would ever bother to send a representative. You just get a default judgment for $10 or whatever. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]iruleatants 3 points4 points5 points 2 hours ago (7 children) Couldn't you get a higher judgement as punitive damages? After all, this isn't just one person being fucked, there are thousands of people buying this pack and getting fucked. Punitive damages were designed to make sure they company doesn't do it in the future. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]TheoryOfSomething 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours ago (0 children) That depends on the law in your jurisdiction, but I suspect not. The other thousands of people don't matter for your case because you don't have standing to bring claims related to them, and the court doesn't have jurisdiction over most of them. In some states, punitive damages can only be enacted by statute. In some states you can never get punitive damages. Europe also generally doesn't recognize punitive damages. And the general rule in the other states is that you can't get punitive damages for breach of contract. And then even if you live in a state where punitive damages can be awarded as part of common law, and you establish there's an independent tort separate from the contract that was violated, you STILL usually have to show some kind of intent. In this case that'd require showing EA knew that the packs were busted and sold them anyway, or something like that. That's such a series of high burdens I'd call it legally impossible. EDIT: And if you want to get into federal court, you have to get certified as a class, which others have talked about. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (6 replies) [–]PitmoundPeeny v2 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (0 children) For the time / effort it’s not worth it. And if you wanted to sue EA in a federal court you’d have to certify as a class action in order to meet the “case and controversy” requirement for $ value of the claim. But since the modern cases like Wal-Mart, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to even certify as a class to hail these large corporate entities into court to pursue even legitimate claims. The difficulty is likely not worth it, even on a class level. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]robby_synclair 0 points1 point2 points 58 minutes ago (1 child) Just hire the most expensive lawyer you can and make EA pay for them too. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]TheoryOfSomething 0 points1 point2 points 46 minutes ago (0 children) Well then you can't go to small claims court, you have to go to real court.

Go back into chat and provide the pic as evidence, or use the call option. Clearly poor Vipin who has probably never heard of hockey let alone played the NHL series has asked his “specialist” which is a call Center manager who has never played the game, jumps to the conclusion that you are upset about your pack pull and trying to scam for free shit. This is the price we pay for 24/7 support when you can fill a call Center in SE Asia for the price of 1 NA worker on minimum wage. I’ve had this happen with them before about various issues, you just need to unfortunately accept that a lot of these CS people are piss-poor and go back in with a bit more to the story so that the next fool doesn’t run the “guy wants free packs” script on you. permalink embed save report give gold reply [–]CrackShack 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children) I played nhl religiously my whole life up until i bought a pack and never recieved it nhl 15.

Once it's reviewed and fixed, @OP should get his guaranteed collectible. If he doesn't, pull out the pitchforks. I completely agree with you on how they handled the call. If it was me handling this, I probably would've said, "I've checked with the specialist team and there's a discrepancy in what is being advertised, and what they understand is included. I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience and that you receive what was promised. We're requesting that you report this to our development team as a bug, using this form here. Once it the issue has been resolved, we can proceed on making sure that you've received all items as advertised." THAT is customer care. Not "Oh, yeah, specialist team says that's not what it says." That comes across as "You're lying to get free stuff."

You were much better than the original rep for sure! However a big complaint I see often escalated is when the CSR suggests to the customer to do something else, like fill out a form to report the bug, or wait to get their problem resolved. In this case, the comer did their part in a.) Paying for the product (This generates revenue for the business & pays ever ones salaries. Great!) b.) Reporting the problem to customer service. The CSR should own the issue and submit the bug report on the players behalf. Additionally if the issue is minor and its clear that the company is at fault, just credit the guy back his purchase so he can make another. The bug probably only surfaces < .01% of the time, so he could most likely just purchase the same pack again and get his item. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]smrto0 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children) Yah, there is some great customer service advice in this thread... But... Then they outsource the CSR work to a company where that CSR can support up to 15 different products/companies and is limited to do exactly what is written in a Knowledge Document. They can’t go off script and even if they did they have zero connection to the actual company you are calling/emailing/messaging about. So, beside them emailing the company on your behalf there isn’t much they can do. Ps. They won’t email because it’s off script and it hurts their metrics to take the time to do so... Sigh, I’m just waiting for them to take customer service to the next level through crowdsourcing. You will literally just talk to another human who is having a similar issue to you and you can console each other. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]Rociel 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children) 6 years of customer service.

It's literally a for profit company that goes around selling accreditation. What you do is go to your credit card company. Your credit card company has far more weight in handling this situation as the item you purchased is not as advertised, however be warned that this could potentially cause a developer to ban your account [but dealing with the BBB wont do shit in most cases anyway]. The other way to do it is call them out on Twitter. I've found really great luck with solving an "unsolvable customer service problem" by just saying what happened on twitter with them tagged and some key hashtags. Problems that had no fix suddenly get fixed within an hour and them calling you. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]streetpack1 3 points4 points5 points 5 hours ago (3 children) Hey thanks for the feedback! Overall I agree with you but Ill elaborate a bit since this got bigger than our sub is used to. It was suggested because others have reported having success reporting them there in the past and to spread the word, not necessarily expecting the BBB to actually do something. The thing is not everybody buys these packs with money either because you can use in game coin. So you make the choice to gamble vs buying a player that you want on the auction house. Going to the credit card company like you mentioned is not the best solution because he risks a ban and further it would be Sony receiving the chargeback or Microsoft. The way they have it structured is fucked too because you need to buy points in order to buy packs. MasterCard/ Visa position would basically be that the service being provided are those points afterwards what you do with them is between you and the company. I think it's at least part of the reason you have to buy points in order to buy packs. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]egnards 2 points3 points4 points 5 hours ago (0 children) At that point you take it to Sony or Microsoft both via their CSR (which may not do much) or via social media. You let it be known that you bought points from them as the provider and their vendor (the studio) screwed you over - Microsoft and Sony both want you to be happy and keep buying stuff. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]ASPD_Account 1 point2 points3 points 5 hours ago (1 child) Charge back your CC for the pack and the game then dummy.

The other thousands of people don't matter for your case because you don't have standing to bring claims related to them, and the court doesn't have jurisdiction over most of them. In some states, punitive damages can only be enacted by statute. In some states you can never get punitive damages. Europe also generally doesn't recognize punitive damages. And the general rule in the other states is that you can't get punitive damages for breach of contract. And then even if you live in a state where punitive damages can be awarded as part of common law, and you establish there's an independent tort separate from the contract that was violated, you STILL usually have to show some kind of intent. In this case that'd require showing EA knew that the packs were busted and sold them anyway, or something like that. That's such a series of high burdens I'd call it legally impossible. EDIT: And if you want to get into federal court, you have to get certified as a class, which others have talked about. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply load more comments (6 replies) [–]PitmoundPeeny v2 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (0 children) For the time / effort it’s not worth it. And if you wanted to sue EA in a federal court you’d have to certify as a class action in order to meet the “case and controversy” requirement for $ value of the claim. But since the modern cases like Wal-Mart, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to even certify as a class to hail these large corporate entities into court to pursue even legitimate claims. The difficulty is likely not worth it, even on a class level. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]robby_synclair 0 points1 point2 points 58 minutes ago (1 child) Just hire the most expensive lawyer you can and make EA pay for them too. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]TheoryOfSomething 0 points1 point2 points 46 minutes ago (0 children) Well then you can't go to small claims court, you have to go to real court. And in the US system, each side almost always pays for their own lawyers. You only get awarded attorney's fees is exceptional cases, particularly 'bad faith' lawsuits. permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]Twerds86 4 points5 points6 points 4 hours ago (0 children) I am not mathematic but $35 dollars x a lot of people is a lot of money permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]jjhhggjjhhgg 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children) It would be a class action permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]Draculea 4 points5 points6 points 3 hours ago (4 children) Wouldn't this count under the many provisions of "retailers and advertisers are not responsible for misprints or typos leading to a misrepresentation"? permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]PitmoundPeeny v2 6 points7 points8 points 3 hours ago (3 children) We’re not talking about a misprint.

Go back into chat and provide the pic as evidence, or use the call option. Clearly poor Vipin who has probably never heard of hockey let alone played the NHL series has asked his “specialist” which is a call Center manager who has never played the game, jumps to the conclusion that you are upset about your pack pull and trying to scam for free shit. This is the price we pay for 24/7 support when you can fill a call Center in SE Asia for the price of 1 NA worker on minimum wage. I’ve had this happen with them before about various issues, you just need to unfortunately accept that a lot of these CS people are piss-poor and go back in with a bit more to the story so that the next fool doesn’t run the “guy wants free packs” script on you. permalink embed save report give gold reply [–]CrackShack 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children) I played nhl religiously my whole life up until i bought a pack and never recieved it nhl 15.
